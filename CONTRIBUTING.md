## 🌟 Core Philosophy

When contributing, keep these principles in mind:

### ✅ **What We Want**
- **Local-first** - User owns their data, works offline
- **Privacy-focused** - No tracking, no data collection
- **Accessible** - Works for systems with disabilities
- **Community-driven** - Built by plural folks, for plural folks
- **Free forever** - Core functionality never paywalled
- **Complementary** - Enhances existing tools, doesn't replace them

### ❌ **What We Don't Want**
- **Cloud-dependent features** - App should work fully offline
- **Tracking or analytics** - Respect user privacy completely
- **Paid features** - Core functionality must stay free
- **Controversial takes** - Software serves everyone, no politics
- **Breaking changes** - Don't break existing installations
- **Scope creep** - Stay focused on chat/communication

## 🔧 Technical Guidelines

### 🗄️ Database Changes
- **Always provide migration path** - Don't break existing data
- **Test with real data** - Use sample systems for testing
- **Backwards compatibility** - Old databases should still work

### 🎨 UI Changes
- **Respect all themes** - Test with different themes
- **Keyboard navigation** - Everything should work without mouse
- **Consistent spacing** - Follow existing UI patterns
- **Responsive design** - Work at different window sizes

### 🔒 Security
- **Validate all inputs** - Never trust user data
