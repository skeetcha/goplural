# üó∫Ô∏è Plural Chat Development Roadmap

## üéØ **Project Vision**
Transform Plural Chat from a basic chat app into the **premier free, open-source plural communication tool** with premium features at $0 cost.

**Core Philosophy:** Everything Discord charges for, we do for free. Everything PluralKit lacks, we provide.

**ü§ù Non-Exclusive Mission:** Plural Chat is **not a replacement** for PluralKit, Simply Plural, or any existing tools. We're here for **everyone** - whether you use other tools or not. Our goal is to **complement and enhance** the plural ecosystem, providing additional options and features that support **anyone who requires them**. The plural community thrives on choice and accessibility, and we're proud to be part of that diverse toolkit.

**üîì Open Source Reality:** This is open source software - meaning anyone can use it, period. This isn't a "personal belief" or political choice, it's literally how open source works. The source code is public, the software is free, and users decide what tools work for them. Some people need features that other tools don't provide, some prefer offline/local solutions, some have accessibility requirements, and some just want different approaches. **Software doesn't have opinions - it serves whoever needs it.** If providing accessible tools to people who need them is controversial, that's a community problem, not a software problem.

## **Phase 1: Feature Parity with Original**

- **UX/UI**: Build an application with EGUI (which will help when building for web)
- **Local first**: Work to implement SQL schema from original
- **PluralKit Integration**: Implement syncing with PluralKit

## **Beyond**

- To be determined later once feature parity has been achieved
