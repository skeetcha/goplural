# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: Plural Community Ethos

## üåà Our Position on Plurality

**Plural Chat is built for ALL plural systems, period.**

This software is created to serve the **entire plural community** regardless of:
- Origin (traumagenic, endogenic, mixed, questioning, etc.)
- System type (DID, OSDD, median, gateway, etc.)
- Terminology preferences
- Personal beliefs about plurality
- Community affiliations

## üö´ What We Won't Tolerate

**This project explicitly rejects:**
- **Origin discourse** - Debates about "real" vs "fake" plurality
- **Gatekeeping** - Excluding systems based on origin or type
- **Terminology policing** - Attacking others for word choices
- **Community drama** - Bringing external conflicts into our space
- **Exclusionary behavior** - Making anyone feel unwelcome

## ü§ù Our Inclusive Approach

**We believe:**
- **Your experience is valid** - We don't question your plurality
- **Diversity strengthens us** - Different perspectives make better software
- **Community over controversy** - We focus on building, not fighting
- **Accessibility for all** - Everyone deserves tools that work for them
- **Respectful disagreement** - We can have different views and still collaborate

## üìã For Contributors

**If you contribute to this project:**
- ‚úÖ **Focus on the code** - Technical contributions are welcome from everyone
- ‚úÖ **Respect all users** - Build features that work for diverse systems
- ‚úÖ **Stay constructive** - Criticism should be about code, not people
- ‚úÖ **Follow our CoC** - Our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to everyone

**We will not accept:**
- ‚ùå **Discriminatory code** - Features that exclude based on origin/type
- ‚ùå **Harmful language** - Comments or documentation that attack groups
- ‚ùå **Drama imports** - Bringing external conflicts into development
- ‚ùå **Gatekeeping PRs** - Contributions that make the software less inclusive

## üéØ Project Goals

**Our mission is simple:**
- Build great software for plural systems
- Make it accessible to everyone
- Foster positive community collaboration
- Avoid getting dragged into community drama

**We measure success by:**
- How many systems find the software useful
- How welcoming our community feels
- How well the software serves diverse needs
- How much positive impact we create

## üîß Technical Focus & Professional Standards

**This is a SOFTWARE project, not a political movement.**

**We operate like a professional software company:**
- Personal biases stay at the door
- We don't gatekeep who uses our software
- Users are users, contributors are contributors
- Professional conduct is expected from everyone
- We judge code quality, not personal beliefs

**We're here to:**
- Write code that works
- Fix bugs that affect users
- Add features people request
- Maintain secure, reliable software
- Support users with technical issues
- Operate with professional standards

**We're NOT here to:**
- Debate the nature of plurality
- Validate or invalidate anyone's experience
- Settle community disagreements
- Police terminology or language
- Take sides in origin discourse
- Judge who "deserves" to use our software

**Professional analogy:** We're like a grocery store - we don't gatekeep who buys our cheese. If you want to use our app and follow basic community standards, welcome aboard. Your personal beliefs are your business, not ours.

## üåü Why This Matters

**The plural community is diverse.** Systems have different:
- Origins and formation reasons
- Internal structures and dynamics
- Terminology preferences
- Community connections
- Technical needs

**Good software serves everyone.** When we exclude people based on origin or beliefs, we:
- Lose valuable perspectives
- Miss important use cases
- Reduce our potential impact
- Perpetuate harmful divisions

**We choose inclusion** because it makes better software AND a better community.

## üì¢ To Drama Seekers

**If you're here to start arguments about plurality:**
- This isn't the place for that
- We won't engage with origin discourse
- Your energy would be better spent elsewhere
- We'll focus on code while you focus on drama

**If you're here to gatekeep who can contribute:**
- Our contributor guidelines are clear
- Technical skill matters, not origin beliefs
- We welcome all systems who follow our CoC
- Your gatekeeping isn't welcome here

**If you're here to cause division:**
- We're building bridges, not walls
- Your attempts to divide us will be ignored
- We're focused on positive community building
- Drama doesn't improve code quality

## ü§î Common Questions

**Q: "But what about [specific controversy]?"**
A: We don't take sides in community drama. We build software.

**Q: "Shouldn't you exclude [specific group]?"**
A: No. Our software serves all plural systems who use it respectfully.

**Q: "What if someone with [specific origin] contributes?"**
A: Great! We evaluate contributions based on technical merit and adherence to our CoC.

**Q: "Why won't you take a stance on [origin debate]?"**
A: Because it's not relevant to building good software. We're developers, not judges.

## üèóÔ∏è Bottom Line

**We're building software, not fighting wars.**

**We operate with professional standards:**
- Personal biases stay at the door
- We don't judge who uses our software
- Professional conduct is expected
- Technical merit is what matters
- We're not here to gatekeep

**Your origin doesn't matter. Your system type doesn't matter. Your community affiliations don't matter.**

**What matters:**
- Do you want to build great software?
- Will you treat other contributors with respect?
