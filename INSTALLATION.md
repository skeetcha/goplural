# ðŸš€ Installation Guide

This guide covers installation of Plural Chat on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

**All platforms need:**
- Go version 1.24.2 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Internet connection (for downloading dependencies)

Exact installation instructions to be written later. Typically one would download golang from [golang.dev] and then run `go mod update` to install dependencies. `go run .` can then be used to run the program without compiling.
