## ⚠️ Known Issues

- **Private Members**: Private members cannot have their avatars downloaded via API (this is expected behavior for privacy protection)
- **Minor "FINAL STATUS" errors**: Occasional minor errors during sync operations (under investigation)
- **Sample Members**: Sample members are not added upon developer cleanup (manual setup required for fresh installations)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher

   ```bash
   https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/plural_chat.git
   ```
3. **Install:**
   ```bash
     cd plural_chat

4. **Choose Theme** - Pick from 15+ modern themes in Settings

## 🎯 Proxy Detection

If you've imported from PluralKit or set up proxy tags, the app will automatically detect them:

- Type `member: hello there` → Auto-selects "member" and sends "hello there"
- Visual feedback shows when proxy is detected
- Clean messages without proxy tags in chat history

### Future Foward Issue
Not everyone uses member: proxy - so being that this was developed in less than 12 hours, it'd be amazing if anyone would want to help out in robustish level fix this!
